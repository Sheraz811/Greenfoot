Although I was enjoying myself, Once I reached grade 9 I decided to take a break from it as I had alot of homework from school. Once I was in grade 11, I began to continue again and have made great improvements in my ability to play the violin.  You can listen to a sample of what I played at a recital in grade 7 by clicking on the link.";
